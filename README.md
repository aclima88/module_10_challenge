** Import the required modules **

** Reflect Tables into SQLAlchemy ORM **
    1. Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper
    2. Create engine to hawaii.sqlite
    3. Reflect an existing database into a new model
    4. View all of the classes that automap found
    5. Save references to each table
    6. Create our session (link) from Python to the DB
    7. Find the most recent date in the data set.
    
** Exploratory Precipitation Analysis **
    1. Find the most recent date in the data set.
    2.Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data and plot the results. Starting from the most recent data point in the database. 
    3.Calculate the date one year from the last date in data set.
    4.Perform a query to retrieve the data and precipitation scores.
    5.  Save the query results as a Pandas DataFrame. Explicitly set the column names.
    6. Use Pandas Plotting with Matplotlib to plot the data.

    7. Use Pandas to calculate the summary statistics for the precipitation data.
    
** Exploratory Station Analysis **
    1. Design a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset
    2.Design a query to find the most active stations (i.e. which stations have the most rows?) List the stations and their counts in descending order.
    3. Using the most active station id from the previous query, calculate the lowest, highest, and average temperature.
    4.Using the most active station id
        a. Query the last 12 months of temperature observation data for this station and plot the results as a histogram
        b. Query temperature observation data for the most active station and the last 12 months
        c. Convert the query result to a pandas DataFrame.
        d. Plot the temperature data as a histogram.
